This is a collection of KNIME knodes/tools to detect the infecting virus
in msÂ² spectra files.

1. The tools AbundanceCorrection and WeightedSimilarityMatrix are part
of the KNIME workflow implementing the tool Pipasic (Penzlin et. al 2014).

2. SixFrameTranslation is used for generating a proteomic library from a
genomic source.

3. All other tools are part of a KNIME workflow to detect which (family
of) virus has infected a (human) cell.
