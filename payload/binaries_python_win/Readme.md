This is the pure python version of the KNIME plug-in.

Dependencies
----

To run the included tools properly you need to have python 2 (2.7.5+ recommended) with the libraries numpy, scipy and biopython installed.

If python2 can not be started from the command line with the command 'python2', you need to specify the path in the payload/binaries.ini file
